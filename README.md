Python code for updating data when user listened to new music and recommending artist to user



Collaborative filtering is another technique that can be used for recommendation.

This technique's core premise is as follows:

Assume that Person A and Person B both enjoy oranges.
Assume that Person A like apples.
Individual B is more likely to agree with A on Apples than any other random person.

The benefits of collaborative filtering are self-evident: We can forecast and offer goods to users based on comparable preferences. Collaborative filtering is classified into two types: user-based and item-based.
~Item Based: which takes similarities between itemsâ€™ consumption histories
~User Based: that considers similarities between user consumption histories and item similarities
